## 1. Introduction
The Bitskraft-CV-Scanner is a web-based application designed to help hiring managers and recruiters automatically parse, analyze, and shortlist resumes based on their relevance to a job description. Key features include:

   -  Uploading resumes in PDF or DOCX format
   -  Extracting and cleaning text, optionally via OCR for scanned documents
   -  Computing semantic relevance versus a provided job description using embeddings
   -  Matching important keywords from the job description to the resume
   -  Producing an overall match score, summary (e.g. ‚ÄúStrong Match‚Äù, ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement‚Äù), and list of matched keywords
   -  Providing a simple web interface (via Streamlit or Flask) for uploading, viewing results, and managing shortlists
   -  Sending email notifications to shortlisted candidates directly through Outlook (win32 client).

## 3. How It Works (User Workflow & Processing Flow)
Here‚Äôs a typical flow from uploading a resume to obtaining a shortlist or match score:

**a. User Uploads Resume & Enters Job Description**

Through the web interface (Flask or Streamlit), the user uploads one or more resumes and provides a job description text.

**b. Text Extraction**
- If the resume is text-based (PDF / DOCX), extract text directly.
- If it‚Äôs a scanned PDF (no embedded text), apply OCR to extract readable content.
 
**c. Preprocessing**

Clean the extracted text: normalize whitespace, remove punctuation, lowercasing, etc.

**d. Keyword Extraction from Job Description**

Extract important terms/technologies/skills from the job description. This may include tech keywords, proper nouns, etc.

**e. Semantic Similarity Calculation**

Compute embeddings for both the resume text and the job description. Use a SentenceTransformer (or similar) model to measure semantic similarity.

**f. Keyword Matching & Scoring**

Check which of the extracted keywords are present in the resume text. Combine this with the semantic similarity to compute an overall match score.

**g. Result Generation**

Produce a summary of the candidate‚Äôs resume with:
- Overall match score
- Semantic relevance component
- A qualitative summary (e.g. ‚ÄúStrong Match‚Äù, ‚ÄúModerate Match‚Äù, etc.)

 
**h. Send Emails**

Shortlisted candidates can be notified directly via Outlook from the browser

  ## 9. Model Configuration

     Customize AI evaluation parameters in model_handling.py :

      - Scoring weights
      - Evaluation criteria
      - Industry-specific requirements
      - Language processing settings

   ---

  ## 10. üìä Evaluation Criteria

     The AI scanner uses a dual-approach evaluation system based on job requirements you  specify:

     Scoring Methodology

        - Semantic Matching(60%): Advanced AI understanding of context, skills, and experience relevance

        - Keyword Matching(40%): Direct matching of specified job requirements and technical terms

      Evaluation Process

        1.Requirements Input: Enter your specific job requirements, skills and qualifications
        2.Semantic Analysis: AI analyzes the contextual relevance and depth of candidate experience
        3.Keyword Detections: System identifies exact matches for required technical skills and qualifications
        4.Weighted Scoring: Combines both approaches with 60-40 weighting for comprehensive evaluation
        5.Final Score: Generates overall compatibility score with detailed breakdown

      What Gets Evaluated

        - Technical Skills Relevance: How well candidate skills align with job requirements
        - Experience Context: Quality and relevance of work experience (semantic understanding)
        - Requirement Fulfillment: Direct matches for must-have qualifications
        - Skill Depth: AI assessment of expertise level in required areas
        - Industry Alignment: Contextual understanding of industry-specific experience
