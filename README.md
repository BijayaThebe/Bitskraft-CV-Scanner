    <img width="778" height="171" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/539ec9ff-aecf-45a3-90a6-2f242b29f154" />

  # Model Configuration

     Customize AI evaluation parameters in model_handling.py :

      - Scoring weights
      - Evaluation criteria
      - Industry-specific requirements
      - Language processing settings

  # üìä Evaluation Criteria

     The AI scanner uses a dual-approach evaluation system based on job requirements you  specify:

     Scoring Methodology

        - Semantic Matching(60%): Advanced AI understanding of context, skills, and experience relevance

        - Keyword Matching(40%): Direct matching of specified job requirements and technical terms

        Evaluation Process

         1.Requirements Input: Enter your specific job requirements, skills and qualifications
         2.Semantic Analysis: AI analyzes the contextual relevance and depth of candidate experience
         3.Keyword Detections: System identifies exact matches for required technical skills and qualifications
         4.Weighted Scoring: Combines both approaches with 60-40 weighting for comprehensive evaluation
         5.Final Score: Generates overall compatibility score with detailed breakdown

         What Gets Evaluated

           - Technical Skills Relevance: How well candidate skills align with job requirements
           - Experience Context: Quality and relevance of work experience (semantic understanding)
           - Requirement Fulfillment: Direct matches for must-have qualifications
           - Skill Depth: AI assessment of expertise level in required areas
           - Industry Alignment: Contextual understanding of industry-specific experience
